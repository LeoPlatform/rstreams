Summary What&amp;rsquo;s a Stream Continuous data systems before event streaming Event streaming compared to APIs
One cannot understand the problems RStreams solves or reason about its implementation/usage without a fundamental understanding of event streaming compared to traditional microservices approaches.
Summary Some systems work with parties that are constantly generating new data. Client data flowing from these parties tends to flow in a sequential order that we call an event stream.</description></item><item><title>Fundamentals</title><link>https://rstreams.org/rstreams-guides/core-concepts/fundamentals/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 11:02:05 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://rstreams.org/rstreams-guides/core-concepts/fundamentals/</guid><description>Event All data that is sent to an RStreams queue is an event. Each event exists to wrap the data contained in the payload attribute. Queues hold events of a consistent type, such as all Employee objects or all Change Order request objects for example.
Queue RStreams is factored around queues. A queue is a named set of events in time sequence order, ordered by their event ID.</description></item><item><title>Event Handling Semantics</title><link>https://rstreams.org/rstreams-guides/core-concepts/event-handling-semantics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 11:02:05 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://rstreams.org/rstreams-guides/core-concepts/event-handling-semantics/</guid><description>ToC
RStreams was designed so that a developer can register a bot (lambda function) that the RStreams Bus will invoke whenever there are new events to be read from a given queue.
It is expected that events could be, and often will be, continuously being produced and flowing into a queue.
So, the desire is for your bot to be invoked and get new events from the a queue and process them, doing this for as long as it safely can before shutting itself down.</description></item></channel></rss>
