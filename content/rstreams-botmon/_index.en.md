RStreams includes a web site called Botmon that provides real time monitoring, data visualization, tracing and debugging. Botmon
is critical for the operability and usability of RStreams as a whole. Botmon provides a visual representation of each
bot or queue in the directed graph of streams that is the RStreams Bus instance it is pointing to.
