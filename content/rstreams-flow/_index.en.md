RStreams Flow is a project template that creates a new empty project to act as a new microservice for you that has everything
an engineer needs to hit the ground running.

Projects created from the RStreams Flow template include libraries and tech that solve common development needs out of the box.
Thus, RStreams Flow prjoects include the RStreams Flow opinionated development decisions to makes choices on how to build, 
test, deploy, monitor and maintain RStreams microservices.  Engineers donâ€™t care about RStreams.  They care about creating 
reactive microservices that leverage native AWS services at scale.  RStreams Flow helps engineers just do their work.

In order to make things just work, RStreams Flow projects have an opinion on the following:

* Running locally
* Unit testing
* Debugging locally
* Project organization
* Project configuration
* Building / bundling artifacts
* Deploying
* Monitoring

RStreams Flow will include a tool to help an RStreams Flow project migrate from one version to a newer version in order
to keep getting new capabilities and features.
