RStreams Node SDK functions that allow you to send and receive events to and from the RStreams bus without the need to
implement pipes and streams.

[put Operation](./put)
: A function that lets you write a single event to the specified RStreams queue

[enrich Operation](./enrich)
: A function that reads from the specified source RStreams queue, lets you transform the events and then sends the 
modified events to the specified destination RStreams queue

[offload Operation](./offload)
: A function that reads from the specified RStreams queue and lets you do something with the events retrieved, perhaps save them in a DB
