{{< notice info >}}You need to understand what a [pipe and stream step in that pipe](../../../streams-primer) is AND 
nothing comes for free.  The cost of working with large amounts of data in near real-time environments
with RStreams is you have to think about what you are doing and what it means with respect to
reading and writing.  It is strongly recommended you read the [Read/Write at Scale](../../../read-write-scale) 
article at some point.{{</ notice >}}
