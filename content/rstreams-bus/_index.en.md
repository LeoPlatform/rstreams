RStreams Flow is an opinionated framework that makes choices on how to build, test, deploy, monitor and maintain RStreams microservices.  Engineers donâ€™t care about RStreams.  They care about creating reactive microservices that leverage AWS services at scale.  RStreams Flow helps engineers just do their work.
